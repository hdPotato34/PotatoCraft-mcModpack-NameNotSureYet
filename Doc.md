## PotatoCraft Modpack Documentation
This is the official PotatoCraft Modpack Docs. PotatoCraft is a medium sized mix genre modpack featuring more than 200 mods and 4 built in shaders. This pack made minor tweaks in the underlying game logic of minecraft, but offers a generally vanilla style gameplay experience. 
PotatoCraft is in its developing phase at the moment, some FTB quest lines are incomplete. These contents will come to place in later updates. 
### General
PotatoCraft made several changes based on the regular Minecraft gaming process. It overhauls the early stages of the game, adopted Sol:Valheim and made changes to the regular food system, as well as added various structures, mobs, and bosses to further enrich the game. 
PotatoCraft also added more immersive elements in the game. Ranging from sound effects, world elements, to the bigger physic overhauls based on Valkyrien Skies engine. 
For the technology fans, PotatoCraft contains the classic tech mod Create and a bunch of its addons. This includes diesel engines, cannons, VS2 compats, and more QoL addons. Try combining create and VS2 to build your own battleships! 
PotatoCraft can also be played leisurely. Be a farmer! Eating well makes you healthy and energetic, so mind your farming. Farmer's Delight and its expansion mods makes sure that you have a diversed diet. 
### Gameplay Features
##### No More Tree Punching
As you enter the world you would soon notice that you cannot punch your trees. Well, doesn't that just make a lot of sense. You should instead try looking around and gather flints to make small knifes, use them to cut grass to obtain fibres, and at last chop down your first tree. What to do next? Well, check the FTB quest/ Advancement Tree for a hint.
##### Spice Of Life: Valheim Edition
You have no hunger bars! But there's a catch, you have got only three hearts left. Try eating some food, maybe that will make you more healthy. Oh, wait, rotten meat makes you puke, so try to avoid that.
There are only so much space in your stomach, so you can only eat three kinds of food at a time. 
##### Stamina
Wouldn't it be absurd if someone who hadn't eaten for days can go and run very fast? The stamina system patches this. Running, jumping, and swimming all consume stamina, which replenish itself over time. Your current health determines your max stamina. If you are very low in health, stamina replenishes itself slower.  
##### Rolling & Crawling
The game added new movements for the player. Press your hotkey to enter crawl mode, or roll in one direction. May come in handy in combat or some special missions.
##### Sleep Tight
Isomnia chases you all the way to minecraft. Skipping the night should not be taken for granted. 
##### Do a Barrel Roll
Elytra flying is now harder and more fun. No more afk-flying. Carefully maneuvre your stance and do a barrel roll. 
##### Gravestone
You would probably die in this game, maybe a lot, in the early stage. But don't panic, Gravestone got you covered. When you die, your stuff will be temporarily stored in a gravestone, which you can mine to retrieve your stuff. 
##### Seasons
Adds seasons to your world to spice things up. Some crops don't grow that well in certain seasons, so take notice of that. 
##### Enhanced Celestials
Sometimes mobs seem especially strong, be careful and stay alive! Different moons means different special effects to your world. You get lucky during a blue moon, you harvest in a harvest moon, and yes, you hide during a blood moon.
##### End Remastered
Minecraft is too easy, people speedrun it in 10 minutes. This mod fixes that, by asking players to gather 12 unique eyes scattered around the world to open the portal to the other side.
##### Valkyrien Skies
Create ships that can fly in minecraft. This could be tricky but its definitely worth it. Imagine minecraft has more physics...That would be like magic. 
Side note: All vanilla boats have been removed from the game, so go build your Eureka Boats. 
##### Infernal Mobs
Seems scary, but you can obtain the rare unique weapons from them. That will be a huge flex on your friends. 
### Quests
##### The twilight Forest
Yeah yeah every modpack has twilight forest. What PotatoCraft aims to bring to you, is a twilight forest experience "As Vanilla As Possible". No more one-shotting bosses, make them a real threat rather than a mere nuisance.
##### Cataclysm
Powerful mobs that hides in different dimensions. They can be tough, so eat well before facing them! They drop some of the most powerful item in the game.
##### Born In Chaos
Find Structures scattered around the overworld containing special mobs and valuable "Dark Metals". Beware of numerous vicious mobs and minibosses along the way. They are really gross. 
##### Mowzie's Mobs
Numerous new mobs to fill up your world, including several bosses with beautiful animations and complex machanics. You might come across them in your journey, but remember, fighting is not the only option!
##### The End
The ender dragon have been buffed to make it more like a proper "end game". It can now launch itself toward you and create big explosions, summon damage fields, and make more movements. Beware! 
### Structures
Hidden, Go Explore
### Other Elements
##### Farmer's Delight
Farmer's Delight added various nutricious food you can cook and eat in your game. Comes in handy cuz in this game, food is power.
##### Exposure
A neat little photography mod to make your game more immersive. Simulates the realistic photo developing process. You don't need screenshots anymore. 
##### Music Maker Mod
Just an idea, but wouldn't it be nice to form a band with your minecraft friends in minecraft. Play music as you wish, compose pieces and make sheet music, everything in music moved into minecraft! 
##### Supplementaries
This is a mod that makes you think stuff like: "Why isn't this thing in vanilla already". A bunch of vanilla style utility blocks to make your life better, and more immersive.
